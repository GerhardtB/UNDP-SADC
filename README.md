# UNDP-SADC
Agricultural and hydrological modelling for watershed restoration in SADC countries. 

# Aim

Aim of the project was use to use the Aquacrop model, which is a field scale -- point based -- model, for a whole country or region i.e run the model on a gridded scale. 

## Modelling
Use of the AquacropOS-Py package, which is the python implementation of the Aquacrop model.

Initial development entailed writing functions to get the input parameters for each gridpoint from global/continental datasets. Second step entailed writing functions to run the model for all gridpoints in specified area.

## Analysis
Analysis inlcluded:
- Probablity of exceedance
- Percentage change
- Boxplots
- Anomalies
